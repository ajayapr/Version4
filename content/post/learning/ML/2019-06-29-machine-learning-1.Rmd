## Pre-notes

* Three types
    + Classification
    + Regression
    + Clustering

* Classification
    - Predict category of new observation
    - Qualitative output into predefined classes
  
* Regression
    - Estimate a regression function that can predict a response value from a bunch of predictors
    - Quantitative response 
    - Previous input to output observations should be known
    
* Clustering
    - Classification but into similar clusters
    - The clusters themselves have to be dissimilar
