## About the series

So, I decided to give _Python_ a try. This blog series is just me jotting down whatever I learn in _Python_. This isn't a tutorial since I am a beginner myself. However, this may serve as a good resource for beginners like me. 

## Chapters

* [Python 1](\post\2019\03\03\python-1)

### Sources

Please note that the example code chunks I am using here weren't developed by myself. I am collating these from multiple sources. I will populate the list below as the number of sources increase.
