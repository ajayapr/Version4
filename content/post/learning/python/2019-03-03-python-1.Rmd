# First lessons

Here is how a simple code looks like. Saving variables as _int_ (integers) or _float_ (floating points) are shown. 

* Exponentiation: ** This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. 

* Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. 

```{python}
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable growth_multiplier
growth_multiplier = 1.1

# Calculate result
result = savings*growth_multiplier**7

# Print out result
print(result)
```

Variable _savings_ is of data type **int** and *growth_multplier* is of data type **float**. Two other data types that is of use are **str** (string) and **bool** (Boolean).

```{python}
# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"

# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True
```

If you want to find the type of a variable, use the function *type()*. This is analogous to the *class()* function in *R*.

An important thing in *Python* is that the operators like '+' have different behaviors based on the type of the variables being operated upon. Sum of two integers will be an integer. If you sum two strings, you will get a concatenated string.

```{python}
"A" + "B"
```

## Type conversion

Seems like type conversion of variables is a useful feature in *Python*. Functions _int(), str(), float(), and bool()_ could be used to convert variables having different types to integer, string, float, and boolean respectively. Here is an application:

```{python}
age = 7
print("I am " + str(age) + " years old")
```

## Python Lists

A convenient way to compile information of multiple data types is to create a list. List is yet another data type in python. It can be assigned to a variable name. Also, lists can contain more lists. A list is defined by putting in the elements of the list inside square brackets "[]". Here is an example code for a list of lists.

```{python}
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# house information as list of lists
house = [["hallway", hall],
         ["kitchen", kit],
         ["living room", liv],
         ["bedroom", bed],
         ["bathroom", bath]]

# Print out house
print(house)

# Print out the type of house
print(type(house))
```
