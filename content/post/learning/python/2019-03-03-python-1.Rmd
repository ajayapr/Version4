# First lessons

Here is how a simple code looks like. Saving variables as _int_ (integers) or _float_ (floating points) are shown. 

* Exponentiation: ** This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. 

* Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. 

```{python}
# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable growth_multiplier
growth_multiplier = 1.1

# Calculate result
result = savings*growth_multiplier**7

# Print out result
print(result)
```

Variable _savings_ is of data type **int** and *growth_multplier* is of data type **float**. Two other data types that is of use are **str** (string) and **bool** (Boolean).

```{python}
# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"

# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True
```

If you want to find the type of a variable, use the function *type()*. This is analogous to the *class()* function in *R*.

An important thing in *Python* is that the operators like '+' have different behaviors based on the type of the variables being operated upon. Sum of two integers will be an integer. If you sum two strings, you will get a concatenated string.

```{python}
"A" + "B"
```

## Type conversion

Seems like type conversion of variables is a useful feature in *Python*. Functions _int(), str(), float(), and bool()_ could be used to convert variables having different types to integer, string, float, and boolean respectively. Here is an application:

```{python}
age = 7
print("I am " + str(age) + " years old")
```
