<h2>The Grouted Shear Stud Connection</h2>
<p>In steel bridge substructures, the conventional practice for connecting the steel columns/piles to the cap beam was through a direct weld. This is shown in the figure below. The yellow oval encircles the region where the column is directly welded to the cap beam.</p>

<p>However, these kind of connections were tested in the lab a few years ago under cyclic lateral loading, i.e., loading cycles along the longitudinal axis of the cap beam. These tests resulted in what you see here:</p>

<p>The columns ruptured at or near the weld region. This is what we call as a brittle mode of failure which is undesirable in any structure. To add to that, these columns were not even able to develop their full section ductility when they failed. In other words, this type of failure limit state can be regarded as “premature”. Hence a conclusion was that the directly welded connections cannot be used in seismic design applications.</p>
<p>After going through a few alternatives, the researchers converged onto the grouted shear stud (GSS) connection which was able to successfully move the failure away from the welded region thereby inducing plastic hinging at the column section with maximum moment. This is a desirable failure mode since it is ductile.</p>
<p>The GSS connection looks like a socket type connection as shown here:</p>

<p>A larger diameter pipe stub is shop welded onto the cap beam first.<br />
<em>Note: A large part of field welding is eliminated if one uses this connection which is desirable from cost and quality control standpoint</em>.<br />
After this, the cap beam + stub assembly is brought to the site where the pile columns will already have been erected. The cap beam + stub assembly is then lowered onto the columns such that the column tops fit into the socket created by the larger diameter stub. The annular region that is hence formed is then grouted with a high strength cementitious grout. The larger diameter connection section acts as a composite section resisting a much larger moment than the capacity of the pile section.</p>
<p>To facilitate this composite action, shear stud connectors are welded on the inside of the stub as well as the outside of the pile top as shown:</p>

<p>By now, I presume, you have formed an idea of what the GSS connection looks like. So how did it fare? Here is the picture of a specimen that failed in a ductile mode:</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>There is some spalling of the grout material but the connection remained fairly undamaged. All the damage was concentrated just below the connection: plastic hinge formation followed by local pile wall buckling. Here is a sample force-displacement hysteresis curve of two tests on similar specimens:</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The specimens seemed to take lateral loading pretty well. Hence, the conclusion was that the GSS connection can potentially be a good candidate for seismic design.</p>
<p>Ok, so that was a summary of the GSS connection: what it is, how it came into being and how well it assisted in lateral load resistance.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-why-not-start-widespread-use" class="section level2">
<h2>So why not start widespread use?</h2>
<p>Despite its shining performance under cyclic lateral loading, the GSS connection has not been fully understood to be employed in actual practice.</p>
<div id="the-grout-variable" class="section level3">
<h3>The grout variable</h3>
<p>High strength cementitious grouts are conventionally used as filler materials in small size applications such as reparing damaged concrete, sockets for dowell rebars, bridge keyway joints etc. One major application of this material is to level floor surfaces to install large machines on machine foundations. However, there are no studies in literature that have investigated large scale applications of cementitious grouts such as that of a GSS connection. To add to that, there are also no studies that have looked at the service life of cementitious grouts in large scale applications. In an application such as the GSS connection, the service life of the grout could be potentially critical since it provides the only load path between the column and the cap beam. Hence, more experiments are warranted before high strength grouts could be used in the GSS connection.</p>
</div>
<div id="consequences-of-deteriorated-grout" class="section level3">
<h3>Consequences of deteriorated grout</h3>
<p>When talking about the service life of the grout, one has to also ask the question how well it maps on to the service life, or structural performance of the entire lateral load resisting system. This is important because it may be the case that a damaged GSS connection could still perform its function retaining the structural integrity of the global system. This has also not been investigated yet.</p>
<p>So what can we do about it? How can we ensure that the GSS connection is indeed the right candidate for the job?</p>

<h1>Research Approach</h1>
<div id="ideally" class="section level2">
<h2>Ideally…</h2>
<p>The ideal approach would be to first test some structure that employs the GSS connection in laboratory conditions. Subsequent specimens should then be exposed to extreme weather conditions for a long time, say 20, 50 to 100 years and then test them for their structural performance. Needless to say, this is impractical.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-more-practical-approach" class="section level2">
<h2>A more practical approach</h2>
<p>Here is what we did. The first step remains the same, i.e., test a structural specimen with GSS connections under laboratory conditions. Then for the second specimen, we physically simulated a deteriorated state of grout within the GSS connection. The assumption is that this simulated deterioration is representative of the deterioration casued by years of extreme weather exposure.</p>
