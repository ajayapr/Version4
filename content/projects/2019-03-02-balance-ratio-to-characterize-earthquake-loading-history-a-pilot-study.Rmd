## Introduction

<div style="text-align: justify"> Earthquake "hazard" is a technical term for a quantitiy or a series of quanitites that captures the effect of an earthquake ground motion on structures. For instance, the peak ground acceleration (PGA) is an extremely simple representation of an earthquake. It essentially is the maximum ground acceleration value observed at a site during an earthquake. Does this tell us everything we want to know about an earthquake? Of course not. Is it useful? Occasionally. But regardless, it is one of the earliest quantification of an earthquake hazard and many structures existing today have been designed to be so called "Earthquake resistant". Later, a more useful parameter was defined for the same purpose. This was spectral acceleration (S$_a$). It is the peak acceleration response of a single degree of freedom (SDOF) oscillator under a given ground motion. While there is only a single PGA for a ground motion, there are infinite number of S$_a$ values, because S$_a$ is a function of the period of the oscillator. As S$_a$ is for acceleration, one could also define spectral displacement (S$_d$) for displacement response of oscillators. These quantifications have been much more useful for design, since they provide us with the maximum values. It is assumed that if you design your structure for the maximum response, it will be able to survive any lower response. </div>

When I say design, what do I specifically mean by it?
