title: About this website

_Namaskaram_,

This website is an attempt to compile ideas pertaining to the areas of Structural Engineering that are of interest to me. In here, you will be able to find a little bit of the work that I have done over the past few years, some article reviews, work that I would like to do in the near future, as well as some teaching materials. Although on first glance this may appear to be my port folio, my vision for this website is for it to be a resource for anyone who wants to get information regarding the academic areas I am interested in.

Sincerely,

Arjun Jayaprakash
