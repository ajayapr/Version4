The grouted shear stud (GSS) connection is a steel bridge column to cap-beam connection developed as an alternative to conventional directly welded connections. The directly welded connections have been shown to fail prematurely in a brittle fashion which is undesirable for seismic design. The GSS connection eliminates any failure at the weld interface by relocating failure on to the columns. This failure is ductile.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Current earthquake hazard intensity measures such as peak ground accelerations, spectral accelerations, spectral displacements etc. do not capture the load history characteristics of real ground motions. A new parameter called “Balance Ratio” that captures peak spectral response displacements on both sides of equilibrium position is investigated for potential utility as an input parameter in state-of-the-art reinforcement bar buckling model.
