### [Structural Consequences of the Grouted Shear Stud Connection](\projects\2019\02\20\structural-consequences-in-gss)

<div style="text-align: justify"> The grouted shear stud (GSS) connection is a steel bridge column to cap-beam connection developed as an alternative to conventional directly welded connections. The directly welded connections have been shown to fail prematurely in a brittle fashion which is undesirable for seismic design. The GSS connection eliminates any failure at the weld interface by relocating failure on to the columns. This failure is ductile.

### [Balance Ratio to Characterize Earthquake Loading History - A Pilot Study History](\projects\2019\03\02\balance-ratio-to-characterize-earthquake-loading-history-a-pilot-study)

<div style="text-align: justify"> Current earthquake hazard intensity measures such as peak ground accelerations, spectral accelerations, spectral displacements etc. do not capture the load history characteristics of real ground motions. A new parameter called "Balance Ratio" that captures peak spectral response displacements on both sides of equilibrium position is investigated for potential utility as an input parameter in state-of-the-art reinforcement bar buckling model.

### [Sensitivity of NLTH Analysis of MDOF Bridges to Choice of Viscous Damping Models](\projects\2017\04\27\sensitivity-of-nlth-analysis-of-mdof-bridges-to-choice-of-viscous-damping-models)

<img src="\figures\Viscous_damping_model.png"
style="max-width:80%;min-width:40px;float:center;">

<div style="text-align: justify"> There has been a rising interest among engineers to conduct non-linear time history (NLTH) analysis as part
of the seismic design procedure for bridges. Strength and stiffness in dynamic
analyses are well understood but the viscous damping model that is mostly being used in commercial analysis
programs, namely initial stiffness proportional Rayleigh damping, is questionable. This study investigated the impact of using different viscous damping models to perform NLTH analysis on bridges. 42 NLTH analysis were performed on MDOF bridge fiber based models, each analysis having a different
combination of specified variables. The variables were classified based on bridge geometry (2 models), ground
motion intensity (3 intensities), abutment fixity conditions (2 conditions) and viscous damping models (4
models). The results were used to assess the sensitivity of response prediction to use of different viscous
damping models. It was found that the responses are sensitive to the choice of damping models. To learn more, click [here](\projects\2017\04\27\sensitivity-of-nlth-analysis-of-mdof-bridges-to-choice-of-viscous-damping-models)... </div>
