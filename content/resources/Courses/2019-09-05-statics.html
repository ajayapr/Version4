<p>Statics deals with the equilibrium of bodies, that is, those that are either at rest or move with a constant velocity. The most effective way of learning the principles of engineering mechanics is to solve as many problems as you can. Here is a generic suggestive list of the steps you take to solve problems in mechanics (Adapted from <em>Engineering mechanics, 14th edition, Hibbeler</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the problem carefully and try to correlate the actual physical situation with the theory studied.</li>
<li>Tabulate the problem data and draw to a large scale any necessary diagrams.</li>
<li>Apply the relevant principles, generally in mathematical form. When writing any equations, be sure they are dimensionally homogeneous.</li>
<li>Solve the necessary equations, and report the answer with no more than three significant figures.</li>
<li>Study the answer with technical judgment and common sense to determine whether or not it seems reasonable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Video Tutorials</h2>
<p>The following are some additional video tutorials I recorded for students in my statics class. The emphaasis of these videos are on solving problems as opposed to teaching concepts.</p>
