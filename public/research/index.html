<div style="text-align: justify">
The grouted shear stud (GSS) connection is a steel bridge column to cap-beam connection developed as an alternative to conventional directly welded connections. The directly welded connections have been shown to fail prematurely in a brittle fashion which is undesirable for seismic design. The GSS connection eliminates any failure at the weld interface by relocating failure on to the columns. This failure is ductile.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Current earthquake hazard intensity measures such as peak ground accelerations, spectral accelerations, spectral displacements etc. do not capture the load history characteristics of real ground motions. A new parameter called “Balance Ratio” that captures peak spectral response displacements on both sides of equilibrium position is investigated for potential utility as an input parameter in state-of-the-art reinforcement bar buckling model.

<div style="text-align: justify">
There has been a rising interest among engineers to conduct non-linear time history (NLTH) analysis as part of the seismic design procedure for bridges. Strength and stiffness in dynamic analyses are well understood but the viscous damping model that is mostly being used in commercial analysis programs, namely initial stiffness proportional Rayleigh damping, is questionable. This study investigated the impact of using different viscous damping models to perform NLTH analysis on bridges. 42 NLTH analysis were performed on MDOF bridge fiber based models, each analysis having a different combination of specified variables. The variables were classified based on bridge geometry (2 models), ground motion intensity (3 intensities), abutment fixity conditions (2 conditions) and viscous damping models (4 models). The results were used to assess the sensitivity of response prediction to use of different viscous damping models. It was found that the responses are sensitive to the choice of damping models.

<div style="text-align: justify">
The grouted shear stud (GSS) connection for steel bridge substructures was developed as a ductile alternative to directly welded column-to-cap-beam connections. During an earthquake, the GSS connection relocates the plastic hinge to the bridge column and eliminates brittle cracking at the weld region thereby providing full strength and ductility capacity. However, the grout material used for fabrication of the GSS connection is susceptible to damage through years of exposure, especially to extreme cold climates. We evaluated the durability of the grout material in cold-climates. A series of experiments was performed to ascertain the durability of commonly available high-strength cementitious grouts. While there were grouts that exhibited good durability, inconsistencies within the material were observed. Find out more in this <a href="\files\Durability_part.pdf">article</a>…
