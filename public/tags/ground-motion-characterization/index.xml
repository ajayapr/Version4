      <description>Introduction Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the impact of ground motion loading history on performance limit-states of RC bridge columns such as longitudinal reinforcement bar-buckling and residual drift ratio. Conventional hazard characterizations such as peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration, and spectral displacement can only capture peak values of ground motion hazard and therefore fall short of providing the necessary information to account for these limit-states. In this study, a parameter termed as the opposite peak ratio is defined, explored, and shown to be useful in reproducing loading history characteristics of ground motions for displacement-based design.</description>
