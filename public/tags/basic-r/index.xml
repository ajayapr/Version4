      <description>This is the first post in a series of posts where I go over some R syntax useful for engineers. I am in no way an expert in R programming, but have been using it to read, analyze and visualize the data I obtain from both physical experiments as well as simulations. The R coding I will be discussing may therefore not be the most efficient way to solve problems.</description>
