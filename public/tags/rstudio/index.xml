      <description>Simple Linear Regression Linear regression is a simple approach to supervised learning. It assumes that the dependence of \(Y\) on \(X_1, X_2, ... X_p\) is linear. These are extremely useful even though they are simple.
The idea is to assume a simple linear model,
\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon \]
where \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) are the intercept and the slope of the model. \(\epsilon\) is the error in prediction.</description>

      <description>R Session: Linear Regression One variable First we need to load some libraries to access some datasets that we will be using.
library(MASS) library(ISLR) One of the datsets is the Boston data:
names(Boston) ## [1] &amp;quot;crim&amp;quot; &amp;quot;zn&amp;quot; &amp;quot;indus&amp;quot; &amp;quot;chas&amp;quot; &amp;quot;nox&amp;quot; &amp;quot;rm&amp;quot; &amp;quot;age&amp;quot; ## [8] &amp;quot;dis&amp;quot; &amp;quot;rad&amp;quot; &amp;quot;tax&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ptratio&amp;quot; &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; &amp;quot;lstat&amp;quot; &amp;quot;medv&amp;quot; These are housing values for the suburbs of Boston. “medv” is the median value of owner occupied houses in Boston, while “lstat” is the lower status of the population in percentage.</description>

      <description>Classification Response is not quantitative but are qualitative. Qualitative variables take values in an unordered set \(\mathcal{C}\), such as
\[ eye\,color\in \{brown,green,blue\}\\ email \in \{spam,ham\} \]
Given a feature vector \(X\) and a qualitative response \(Y\) taking values in the set \(\mathcal{C}\), the classification task is to build a function \(C(X)\) that takes as input the feature vector \(X\) and predicts its value for \(Y\), i.e., \(C(X) \in \mathcal{C}\). Often we are more interested in estimating the probabilities that \(X\) belongs to each category in \(\mathcal{C}\).</description>

      <title>R for engineers - Basics</title>

      <description>This is the first post in a series of posts where I go over some R syntax useful for engineers. I am in no way an expert in R programming, but have been using it to read, analyze and visualize the data I obtain from both physical experiments as well as simulations. The R coding I will be discussing may therefore not be the most efficient way to solve problems.</description>
