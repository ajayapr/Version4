      <description>Introduction to Regression Models The idea is obtain a prediction model for a response variable, for instance, sales of a particular item, as a function of the advertising cost for TV, newspaper, and radio. This is to make a decision on how to better spend your money if you are trying to sell something.
In other words, we are finding a function \(f(X)\), \(X\) is a vector with multiple variables \((X_1, X_2, X_3 .</description>

      <description>Classification Response is not quantitative but are qualitative. Qualitative variables take values in an unordered set \(\mathcal{C}\), such as
\[ eye\,color\in \{brown,green,blue\}\\ email \in \{spam,ham\} \]
Given a feature vector \(X\) and a qualitative response \(Y\) taking values in the set \(\mathcal{C}\), the classification task is to build a function \(C(X)\) that takes as input the feature vector \(X\) and predicts its value for \(Y\), i.e., \(C(X) \in \mathcal{C}\). Often we are more interested in estimating the probabilities that \(X\) belongs to each category in \(\mathcal{C}\).</description>

      <description>Statics deals with the equilibrium of bodies, that is, those that are either at rest or move with a constant velocity. The most effective way of learning the principles of engineering mechanics is to solve as many problems as you can. Here is a generic suggestive list of the steps you take to solve problems in mechanics (Adapted from Engineering mechanics, 14th edition, Hibbeler).
 Read the problem carefully and try to correlate the actual physical situation with the theory studied.</description>

      <description>Data Types Here is how a simple code looks like. Saving variables as int (integers) or float (floating points) are shown.
 Exponentiation: ** This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right.
 Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right.
  # Create a variable savings savings = 100 # Create a variable growth_multiplier growth_multiplier = 1.</description>
