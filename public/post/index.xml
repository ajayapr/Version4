      <description>Introduction to Regression Models The idea is obtain a prediction model for a response variable, for instance, sales of a particular item, as a function of the advertising cost for TV, newspaper, and radio. This is to make a decision on how to better spend your money if you are trying to sell something.
In other words, we are finding a function \(f(X)\), \(X\) is a vector with multiple variables \((X_1, X_2, X_3 .</description>

      <description>Simple Linear Regression Linear regression is a simple approach to supervised learning. It assumes that the dependence of \(Y\) on \(X_1, X_2, ... X_p\) is linear. These are extremely useful even though they are simple.
The idea is to assume a simple linear model,
\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon \]
where \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) are the intercept and the slope of the model. \(\epsilon\) is the error in prediction.</description>

      <description>R Session: Linear Regression One variable First we need to load some libraries to access some datasets that we will be using.
library(MASS) library(ISLR) One of the datsets is the Boston data:
names(Boston) ## [1] &amp;quot;crim&amp;quot; &amp;quot;zn&amp;quot; &amp;quot;indus&amp;quot; &amp;quot;chas&amp;quot; &amp;quot;nox&amp;quot; &amp;quot;rm&amp;quot; &amp;quot;age&amp;quot; ## [8] &amp;quot;dis&amp;quot; &amp;quot;rad&amp;quot; &amp;quot;tax&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ptratio&amp;quot; &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; &amp;quot;lstat&amp;quot; &amp;quot;medv&amp;quot; These are housing values for the suburbs of Boston. “medv” is the median value of owner occupied houses in Boston, while “lstat” is the lower status of the population in percentage.</description>

      <description>Classification Response is not quantitative but are qualitative. Qualitative variables take values in an unordered set \(\mathcal{C}\), such as
\[ eye\,color\in \{brown,green,blue\}\\ email \in \{spam,ham\} \]
Given a feature vector \(X\) and a qualitative response \(Y\) taking values in the set \(\mathcal{C}\), the classification task is to build a function \(C(X)\) that takes as input the feature vector \(X\) and predicts its value for \(Y\), i.e., \(C(X) \in \mathcal{C}\). Often we are more interested in estimating the probabilities that \(X\) belongs to each category in \(\mathcal{C}\).</description>

      <description>My teaching interests and philosophy have been heavily influenced by the faculty members I have worked with or have attended lectures of, throughout my time at North Carolina State University (NCSU). Along the way, I have picked up effective teaching techniques from each one of them which has prepared me to develop a style of my own. I am an instructor for the course CE 214: Engineering Mechanics-Statics at NCSU.</description>

      <description>Data Types Here is how a simple code looks like. Saving variables as int (integers) or float (floating points) are shown.
 Exponentiation: ** This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right.
 Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right.
  # Create a variable savings savings = 100 # Create a variable growth_multiplier growth_multiplier = 1.</description>

      <description>My approach to teaching an undergraduate level course is different from my plan to teach a graduate level course. My experience from observing and teaching the statics course, as well as having been an undergraduate student, has lead me to believe that a majority of the students find it hard to make the transition from high school to college level. Hence, my philosophy for teaching fundamental courses like statics, mechanics of solids, reinforced concrete etc.</description>

      <description>Basic concept It is all about solving a system of simultaneous linear equations, referring back to high school maths. Say we have,
\[ x + 2y + z = 2\] \[ 3x + 8y + z = 12\] \[ 4y + z = 2\]
we can convert this set of equations into a single equation through matrices. Just compile all the coefficients onto a matrix \(\textbf{A}\) and the variables into an unknown vector \(\textbf{x}\).</description>

      <description>About the series I have been watching MIT Open Courseware lectures on Linear Algebra by Dr. Gilbert Strang to refresh my memory of the concepts. I had watched this series a couple of years ago while I was taking the Advanced Finite Element course at my university. At that time, I thought I had a good grasp of the concepts. However, two years of non-usage has left me completely ignorant of the core concepts of matrix operations.</description>

      <description>About the series So, I decided to give Python a try. This blog series is just me jotting down whatever I learn in Python. This isn’t a tutorial since I am a beginner myself. However, this may serve as a good resource for beginners like me.
 Chapters  Python 1: First Lessons Python 2: Control Statements  Sources Please note that the example code chunks I am using here weren’t developed by myself.</description>
