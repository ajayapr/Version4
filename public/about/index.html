<main>
<p>Have you ever had this happen to you when a great idea pops up in your head from nowhere and you feel, &ldquo;Wow, this is a great idea, I need to write this down, hmm&hellip; maybe later!&rdquo; A few hours later, you don&rsquo;t even remember the existence of the idea.</p>

<p>I have had that happen multiple times to me and one reason for not being able to follow up on ideas that my past self has had was lack of a specific space that I can quickly note it down. A second reason was a lack of motivation to even pursue them.</p>

<p>This website is an attempt to compile ideas pertaining to the areas of Structural Engineering that are of interest to me. The website is a solution that directly addresses the first problem of not having a space for ideas. As for the second problem regarding motivation, I have been sufficiently motivated by my intention to seek an academic position after my imminent graduation.</p>

<p>In here, you will be able to find a little bit of the work that I have done over the past few years, some article reviews, work that I would like to do in the near future, as well as some teaching materials.</p>
