      <description>Basic concept It is all about solving a system of simultaneous linear equations, referring back to high school maths. Say we have,
\[ x + 2y + z = 2\] \[ 3x + 8y + z = 12\] \[ 4y + z = 2\]
we can convert this set of equations into a single equation through matrices. Just compile all the coefficients onto a matrix \(\textbf{A}\) and the variables into an unknown vector \(\textbf{x}\).</description>

      <description>About the series I have been watching MIT Open Courseware lectures on Linear Algebra by Dr.Â Gilbert Strang to refresh my memory of the concepts. I had watched this series a couple of years ago while I was taking the Advanced Finite Element course at my university. At that time, I thought I had a good grasp of the concepts. However, two years of non-usage has left me completely ignorant of the core concepts of matrix operations.</description>
