      <description>Statics deals with the equilibrium of bodies, that is, those that are either at rest or move with a constant velocity. The most effective way of learning the principles of engineering mechanics is to solve as many problems as you can. Here is a generic suggestive list of the steps you take to solve problems in mechanics (Adapted from Engineering mechanics, 14th edition, Hibbeler).
 Read the problem carefully and try to correlate the actual physical situation with the theory studied.</description>

      <description>Introduction There has been a rising interest among engineers to conduct non-linear time history (NLTH) analysis as part of the seismic design procedure for bridges. A good understanding of member parameters such as strength, stiffness and damping are crucial for accurate results from NLTH analysis. Strength and stiffness in dynamic analyses are well understood but the viscous damping model that is mostly being used in commercial analysis programs, namely initial stiffness proportional Rayleigh damping, is questionable.</description>
