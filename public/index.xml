      <description>Introduction to Regression Models The idea is obtain a prediction model for a response variable, for instance, sales of a particular item, as a function of the advertising cost for TV, newspaper, and radio. This is to make a decision on how to better spend your money if you are trying to sell something.
In other words, we are finding a function \(f(X)\), \(X\) is a vector with multiple variables \((X_1, X_2, X_3 .</description>

      <description>Simple Linear Regression Linear regression is a simple approach to supervised learning. It assumes that the dependence of \(Y\) on \(X_1, X_2, ... X_p\) is linear. These are extremely useful even though they are simple.
The idea is to assume a simple linear model,
\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon \]
where \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\) are the intercept and the slope of the model. \(\epsilon\) is the error in prediction.</description>

      <description>R Session: Linear Regression One variable First we need to load some libraries to access some datasets that we will be using.
library(MASS) library(ISLR) One of the datsets is the Boston data:
names(Boston) ## [1] &amp;quot;crim&amp;quot; &amp;quot;zn&amp;quot; &amp;quot;indus&amp;quot; &amp;quot;chas&amp;quot; &amp;quot;nox&amp;quot; &amp;quot;rm&amp;quot; &amp;quot;age&amp;quot; ## [8] &amp;quot;dis&amp;quot; &amp;quot;rad&amp;quot; &amp;quot;tax&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ptratio&amp;quot; &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; &amp;quot;lstat&amp;quot; &amp;quot;medv&amp;quot; These are housing values for the suburbs of Boston. “medv” is the median value of owner occupied houses in Boston, while “lstat” is the lower status of the population in percentage.</description>

      <description>Classification Response is not quantitative but are qualitative. Qualitative variables take values in an unordered set \(\mathcal{C}\), such as
\[ eye\,color\in \{brown,green,blue\}\\ email \in \{spam,ham\} \]
Given a feature vector \(X\) and a qualitative response \(Y\) taking values in the set \(\mathcal{C}\), the classification task is to build a function \(C(X)\) that takes as input the feature vector \(X\) and predicts its value for \(Y\), i.e., \(C(X) \in \mathcal{C}\). Often we are more interested in estimating the probabilities that \(X\) belongs to each category in \(\mathcal{C}\).</description>

      <description>My teaching interests and philosophy have been heavily influenced by the faculty members I have worked with or have attended lectures of, throughout my time at North Carolina State University (NCSU). Along the way, I have picked up effective teaching techniques from each one of them which has prepared me to develop a style of my own. I am an instructor for the course CE 214: Engineering Mechanics-Statics at NCSU.</description>

      <description>My research interests fall within the broad area of performance-based seismic design and assessment (PBSE). A major advantage of performance-based principles is the capability to map conventional structural limit states on to clear decision variables such as economic losses or savings. For example, while designing a new multi-storey building, it is now possible for an engineer to quantify and communicate the probability of incurring a certain amount of monetary loss in a given period of time or under a specific natural hazard.</description>

      <description>Statics deals with the equilibrium of bodies, that is, those that are either at rest or move with a constant velocity. The most effective way of learning the principles of engineering mechanics is to solve as many problems as you can. Here is a generic suggestive list of the steps you take to solve problems in mechanics (Adapted from Engineering mechanics, 14th edition, Hibbeler).
 Read the problem carefully and try to correlate the actual physical situation with the theory studied.</description>

 Exponentiation: ** This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right.
 Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right.

 Experimental and computational methods for assessment and retrofitting of existing infrastructure
 Performance based design of structural systems against natural hazards  Large Scale Experiments of Structures In 2017, American Society of Civil Engineers published a comprehensive infrastructure report card for the United States that gave an overall grade of D+.</description>

      <description>My approach to teaching an undergraduate level course is different from my plan to teach a graduate level course. My experience from observing and teaching the statics course, as well as having been an undergraduate student, has lead me to believe that a majority of the students find it hard to make the transition from high school to college level. Hence, my philosophy for teaching fundamental courses like statics, mechanics of solids, reinforced concrete etc.</description>

      <description>Introduction Earthquake “hazard” is a technical term for a quantitiy or a series of quanitites that captures the effect of an earthquake ground motion on structures. For instance, the peak ground acceleration (PGA) is an extremely simple representation of an earthquake. It essentially is the maximum ground acceleration value observed at a site during an earthquake. Does this tell us everything we want to know about an earthquake? Of course not.</description>

      <description>Basic concept It is all about solving a system of simultaneous linear equations, referring back to high school maths. Say we have,
\[ x + 2y + z = 2\] \[ 3x + 8y + z = 12\] \[ 4y + z = 2\]
we can convert this set of equations into a single equation through matrices. Just compile all the coefficients onto a matrix \(\textbf{A}\) and the variables into an unknown vector \(\textbf{x}\).</description>

      <description>About the series I have been watching MIT Open Courseware lectures on Linear Algebra by Dr. Gilbert Strang to refresh my memory of the concepts. I had watched this series a couple of years ago while I was taking the Advanced Finite Element course at my university. At that time, I thought I had a good grasp of the concepts. However, two years of non-usage has left me completely ignorant of the core concepts of matrix operations.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in a series of posts where I go over some R syntax useful for engineers. I am in no way an expert in R programming, but have been using it to read, analyze and visualize the data I obtain from both physical experiments as well as simulations. The R coding I will be discussing may therefore not be the most efficient way to solve problems.</description>

      <description>Background and Motivation The Grouted Shear Stud Connection In steel bridge substructures, the conventional practice for connecting the steel columns/piles to the cap beam was through a direct weld. This is shown in the figure below. The yellow oval encircles the region where the column is directly welded to the cap beam.
 Figure 1: From a bridge in Alaska, USA  However, these kind of connections were tested in the lab a few years ago under cyclic lateral loading, i.</description>

      <description>Introduction There has been a rising interest among engineers to conduct non-linear time history (NLTH) analysis as part of the seismic design procedure for bridges. A good understanding of member parameters such as strength, stiffness and damping are crucial for accurate results from NLTH analysis. Strength and stiffness in dynamic analyses are well understood but the viscous damping model that is mostly being used in commercial analysis programs, namely initial stiffness proportional Rayleigh damping, is questionable.</description>

      <description>Namaskaram,
This website is an attempt to compile ideas pertaining to the areas of Structural Engineering that are of interest to me. In here, you will be able to find a little bit of the work that I have done over the past few years, some article reviews, work that I would like to do in the near future, as well as some teaching materials. Although on first glance this may appear to be my port folio, my vision for this website is for it to be a resource for anyone who wants to get information regarding the academic areas I am interested in.</description>

Projects Structural Consequences of the Grouted Shear Stud Connection The grouted shear stud (GSS) connection is a steel bridge column to cap-beam connection developed as an alternative to conventional directly welded connections. The directly welded connections have been shown to fail prematurely in a brittle fashion which is undesirable for seismic design. The GSS connection eliminates any failure at the weld interface by relocating failure on to the columns.</description>
