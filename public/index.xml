      <description>This is the first post in a series of posts where I go over some R syntax useful for engineers. I am in no way an expert in R programming, but have been using it to read, analyze and visualize the data I obtain from both physical experiments as well as simulations. The R coding I will be discussing may therefore not be the most efficient way to solve problems.</description>

      <description>Background and Motivation The Grouted Shear Stud Connection In steel bridge substructures, the conventional practice for connecting the steel columns/piles to the cap beam was through a direct weld. This is shown in the figure below. The yellow oval encircles the region where the column is directly welded to the cap beam.
 Figure 1: From a bridge in Alaska, USA  However, these kind of connections were tested in the lab a few years ago under cyclic lateral loading, i.</description>
